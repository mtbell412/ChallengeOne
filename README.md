# Description
I updated the tags in order to match their semantics so that a third party could better undestand the URL. I also added alts to the images so that they have corresponding desctriptions. Lastly, I updated the CSS file to follow the same parent/child relationship when adjusting style for the different sections/nav/aside. etc. I uploaded the final commit before completing the readme so the last commit will read final commit-readme.
